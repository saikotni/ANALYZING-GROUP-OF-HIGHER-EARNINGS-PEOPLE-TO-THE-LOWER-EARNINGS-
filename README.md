# ANALYZING-GROUP-OF-HIGHER-EARNINGS-PEOPLE-TO-THE-LOWER-EARNINGS-
To perform the statistical tests such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values and get a better results  to check the changes for removing the dataset and also correlation with heatmaps and perform correlation between the features using the  Pearson's correlation coefficent method.
Following steps are taken : 
Importing the libraries
loading the datasets
Data preprocessing
knowing the statistics of dataset
finding the null values and replacing the mean value
exploratory data analysis
finding outliers
Removing outliers
correlation between the features using Pearson's Correlation Coefficient
Hypothesis testing and p-test
